This project analyzes Trader Joe's store locations in New York City to identify patterns and recommend strategic ZIP codes for future expansion. Using demographic data, transit accessibility, and retail environment analysis, we developed a similarity scoring model to identify high-potential neighborhoods that match the profile of successful existing locations.
